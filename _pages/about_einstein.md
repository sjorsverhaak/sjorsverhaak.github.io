I am a doctoral candidate in political thought whose research interests are shaped by a concern with thinking the global ecological crisis from the standpoint of political theory. More specifically, my dissertation looks at the role that Earth—in its narrative, metaphoric, and imaginative dimensions—plays in environmental politics. My project explores this through a critique of “green” economic models, examining the connections between animal liberation and deep ecology, the theoretical underpinnings of the Rights of Nature movement, and the figure of Gaia. By bridging these topics through a structuring focus on conceptual role of Earth, I aim to reorient political theory to the imaginaries that sustain (and are sustained by) politics in response to the urgent challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.
